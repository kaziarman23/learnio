# Learnio

A student-centered e-learning platform that connects learners with educators through a structured course enrollment and payment system. Learnio provides tools for students to enroll in paid courses, teachers to manage their course applications, and admins to control platform roles and permissions.

---

## 🌟 **Project Purpose**
The goal of this project is to create a learning management platform where users can discover, apply, and pay for online courses, while teachers and admins can manage roles and enrollment statuses efficiently. It also serves as a full-stack practice app utilizing Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for state and API management.

### How to test the admin flow
1. Sign in using the credentials above via **Login**.
2. Navigate to **Admin → Manage Users (/admin/users)** to review & approve teacher requests.
3. Open **Admin → All Enrollments (/admin/enrollments)** to view platform-wide transactions and statuses.

> **Important:** These credentials are for demo purposes only. Do **not** reuse them in production. Consider rotating or disabling this account before any public launch.

## 🧭 **Quick Links**
- **Login:** `/login`
- **Admin Users:** `/admin/users`
- **Admin Enrollments:** `/admin/enrollments`
- **Teacher Courses:** `/teacher/courses`
- **Course Catalog:** `/courses`

---

## 🛡️ **Security Note for Demo Environments**
- Restrict demo accounts with least-privilege access and clear audit logs.
- Tag demo data so it’s easy to purge.
- Never commit real secrets. Keep Stripe keys, JWT secrets, and Firebase config in `.env`.

---

## ⚙️ **Environment Variables (example)**
Create a `.env` file (or platform-specific environment panel) and add the required variables:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
```

(Keep server-side secrets—JWT secret, Stripe secret key, Mongo URI—on the backend only.)

---

## ✅ **Smoke Test Checklist (Admin)**
- [ ] Can log in as admin without errors
- [ ] Can open `/admin/users` and see pending teacher requests
- [ ] Can approve/reject teacher requests and see status update
- [ ] Can open `/admin/enrollments` and see transactions list
- [ ] Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
